      'During my years of study at the Federal Institute of Araraquara, I completed a technical course integrated with high school, which lasted four years. It was during this time that I had my first exposure to and learned programming languages, including HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, JavaScript, AJAX and jQuery. This course provided me with a solid foundation of both basic and technological knowledge. As part of my course completion, I developed a special project. The primary goal of this project was to integrate and apply the knowledge acquired throughout my education. I chose to create an initiative aimed at the non-profit organization "Parque Vivo". In this project, I managed to combine my technical and academic learnings, contributing significantly to a relevant and beneficial cause for the community. Not only did this experience solidify my knowledge, but it also allowed me to witness firsthand the practical possibilities of applying technology to impactful social projects.',
